Certainly! Let's update the app description to reflect the specific features you've mentioned:

### App Overview:
Welcome to my first Android app hosted on GitHub! This application is built using the MVVM architecture, incorporating Room for local data persistence and LiveData for reactive UI updates. The key features of this app are centered around enhancing user experience with dark mode, a search functionality for notes, and the ability to switch between grid and list views.

### Key Features:

1. **MVVM Architecture:**
   - The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns for data, UI, and business logic. This results in a maintainable and scalable codebase.

2. **Room Database:**
   - Utilizing Room for local data persistence, making it easier to store and retrieve notes. Room simplifies database interactions and provides a solid foundation for data management.

3. **LiveData Integration:**
   - LiveData is employed to observe changes in the underlying data, allowing for automatic and reactive updates to the UI. This contributes to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

4. **Dark Mode:**
   - The app offers a dark mode feature, providing users with the flexibility to switch between light and dark themes. This not only enhances visual comfort but also reflects a commitment to modern design standards.

5. **Search Notes:**
   - Empowering users with the ability to search for specific notes efficiently. The search functionality enhances usability, especially for users with a large number of notes.

6. **Grid and List Views:**
   - Users can customize their viewing experience by switching between grid and list views. This feature provides a personalized approach to organizing and consuming notes.
